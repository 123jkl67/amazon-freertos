recheck checkoptionsouter proof (len >= 8)

checkoptionsinner model:
  assert and check that pucptr is a valid pointer into ethernet buffer, not just valid pointer.
  experiment with making list element owners unconstrained.
  add comment saying it is a list of one element (one unconstrained element models finding it or not finding it)
     consider validating this lookup function independently, then don't even care what the list is.

creating the socket uses a strange malloc that only mallocs some of the bytes.

check that the sizes of buffers are larger than what pointer encoding allows.
experiment with size 0x00ffffff and offset 0x00ffff00
try object bits 4 and make size and offset larger
change the 0x000ffffff magic constant to a define

in all function abstractions, check that the incoming and outgoing pointers are valid pointers into the buffer (eg, readnamefield abstr)
Always check that the first and last touched bytes are within the buffer.

For dhcp parser, can we check that it returns pdFALSE on a small buffer.

Everywhere I have an assume, make them a debug assert on the production code.
